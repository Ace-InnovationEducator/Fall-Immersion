   - Share brief examples or a quote regarding trust to give context.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Facilitate a group discussion on trust.
   - Split geniuses into two groups to discuss whether trust should be earned or given.
   - Allow each group 5 minutes to come up with key points for their stance.
   - Have a mini-debate where each group presents their arguments.

### 4. **Activity: Trust Fall (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Conduct a trust-building exercise.
   - Explain the trust fall activity emphasizing safety and respect.
   - Facilitate the activity in a safe space with geniuses in pairs or small groups.
   - After the activity, have a short discussion on how they felt and what they learned.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize key points and reflect on the lesson.
   - Summarize the main ideas discussed about trust.
   - Distribute handouts with reflection prompts: "Reflect on your trust fall experience. How did it influence your views on trust? Should trust be earned, given, or both?"
   - Give geniuses a few minutes to write their reflections.
   - Ask a few geniuses to share their reflections with the class if they are comfortable.

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in group discussions, debate, and trust fall activity.
- Thoughtfulness and completeness of written reflections.
- Informal feedback through genius sharing and open discussion.

## **Extra Activities:**
- For geniuses who finish early, provide additional quotes about trust to analyze and write responses.
- Allow geniuses to research a figure known for trustworthiness and prepare a brief presentation.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- After teaching, reflect on genius engagement and understanding.
- Note how geniuses responded to both the discussions and the trust fall activity.
- Consider adjustments for future lessons based on which activities were most effective.
