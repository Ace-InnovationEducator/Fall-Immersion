### Lesson Plan: Introduction to Form Submission in JavaScript

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
In this lesson, geniuses will learn how to create a basic HTML form and use JavaScript to handle form submissions. They will learn how to validate form data and provide feedback to users.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand the structure of an HTML form
- Use JavaScript to validate form data
- Handle form submission using JavaScript
- Provide feedback to users upon form submission

## **Materials:**
- Computers with internet access
- Text editor (such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or Notepad++)
- Projector or whiteboard for demonstrations

## **Standards:**
- Understanding HTML form elements
- Basic JavaScript event handling
- Client-side form validation

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Introduce the topic of form submission and its importance in web development.
   - Discuss the role of forms in collecting user data on websites.
   - Show examples of common forms (e.g., contact form, registration form).

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Teach geniuses how to create forms in HTML.
   - Explain various form elements like input, textarea, and button.
   - Demonstrate creating a simple form in HTML.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Guide geniuses through adding form validation and handling submission with JavaScript.
   - Walk geniuses through the provided `script.js` code.
   - Explain how `event.preventDefault()` works to prevent form submission and handle it manually.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Allow geniuses to practice form submission and validation on their own.
   - Have geniuses complete starter code for script.js
   - Assign genisuses to create a form with additional fields (e.g., phone number, address) and validate them.
   - Encourage geniuses to add custom alerts or messages upon form submission.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the lesson and reinforce key points.
   - Review the main concepts covered: HTML forms, JavaScript validation, and form submission handling.

## **Assessment:**
- Monitor geniuses during independent practice to ensure they are correctly implementing form validation and submission.
- Review their code and provide feedback.

## **Extra Activities:**
- For geniuses who finish early, challenge them to style the form using CSS.
- Ask geniuses to implement more advanced validation (e.g., password strength check).

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- **Reflection:** Evaluate how well geniuses grasped the concepts. Were there any common difficulties?
- **Takeaways:** Collect feedback from geniuses about what they enjoyed and what could be improved in the lesson. Consider pacing adjustments or additional clarifications based on genius feedback.
