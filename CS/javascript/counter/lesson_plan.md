## **Duration:**
45 Minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS



## **Objectives:**
- [Objective 1]: Learn how to connect HTML files to JavaScript files
- [Objective 2]: Learn how to get the value of an P tag
- [Objective 3]: Update the value of a P tag and display it on the screen

## **Materials:**
- List all materials needed for the lesson, including handouts, technology, etc.
- Visual Studio Code, Cursor
    - Live Server extension

## **Standards:**
- Basic HTML
- Basic JavaScript
- Basic DOM Manipulation

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 30 minutes)**
   - Start with 3 files index.html, script.js, and style.css
   - Index.html is the main file that will hold the content of the page
   - Script.js is the file that will hold the JavaScript code
   - Style.css is the file that will hold the CSS code
   - Open index.html in the browser, using live server so geniuses can see the page (blank)
   - Add html5 boilerplate to index.html with title Counter App
   - Add a button to index.html with onclick attribute that calls a function called counter()
   - Add a p tag to index.html with id counter-number
   - Add a script.js file to the same directory as index.html
   - Open script.js and write a function called counter() that will increment the value of the p tag with id counter-number

### 2. ** Javascript (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - Explain that the button is calling the counter() function when it is clicked
   - Explain that the counter() function is incrementing the value of the p tag with id counter-number
   - Explain that the p tag with id counter-number is the element that will display the counter
   - Explain that the counter() function is accessing the p tag with id counter-number and updating the innerHTML
   - Explain that the counter() function is using the parseInt() function to convert the innerHTML to an integer
   - Explain that the counter() function is using the += operator to increment the value of the p tag with id counter-number

### 3. **Style [Bonus] (Time: 5 minutes)**
    - Add a style.css file to the same directory as index.html
    - Add a style to the p tag with id counter-number that will make the text red
    - Add a style to the p tag with id counter-number that will make the text bold
    - Add a style to the p tag with id counter-number that will make the text 20px

## **Assessment:**
- Check to see if students have the correct code in their script.js file
- Check to see if students have the correct code in their index.html file
- [Bonus] Check to see if students have the correct code in their style.css file 

## **Extra Activities:**
- N/A

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- Students will learn how to connect HTML files to JavaScript files
- Students will create interactive content on their webpages.
