## Lesson Plan: Customizing Bootstrap with Sass - Art Gallery App

## **Duration:**
1 hour and 30 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
In this lesson, geniuses will learn how to customize Bootstrap using Sass to create an art gallery app. They will practice compiling Sass to CSS and modifying Bootstrap's default variables to change the appearance of the web application.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand how to set up a Bootstrap project with Sass.
- Learn to customize Bootstrap components using Sass variables.
- Create a responsive and visually appealing art gallery app.
- Develop skills in compiling Sass to CSS.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with internet access
- Code editor (such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or Notepad++)
- Bootstrap documentation: [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- Sass documentation: [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
- Starter code files (`index.html`, `styles.scss`)

## **Standards:**
- Utilizing CSS pre-processors (Sass) to enhance web development workflow.
- Customizing CSS frameworks for specific design needs.
- Integrating responsive design principles in web projects.

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Introduce Sass and its benefits in web development.
   - Explain the purpose of CSS pre-processors like Sass (e.g., variables, nesting, mixins).
   - Brief overview of Bootstrap customization.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:**
   - Explain how to set up a Bootstrap project with Sass.
   - Demonstrate including Bootstrap and Sass in a project and compiling Sass to CSS.
   - Go through the provided `index.html` and `styles.scss` starter code, highlighting the blanks that need completion.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 30 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Guide geniuses through completing the blanks in the provided code.
   - Work together on adding a third navigation link with the text 'Contact' in the navbar.
   - Guide geniuses to complete the button in the hero section with the text 'Learn More'.
   - Assist geniuses as they complete the details for the first card and the modal.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Allow geniuses to complete and customize their gallery apps independently.
   - Geniuses should finish the assigned sections (completing cards, modal content, etc.).
   - Encourage geniuses to customize Bootstrap variables in `styles.scss` and recompile their Sass file.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the key points of the lesson and reinforce learning.
   - Review the completed project, highlighting the use of customized Bootstrap components.
   - Discuss the importance of pre-processors like Sass for maintaining large CSS files.
   - Preview the next lesson, which might involve more advanced Bootstrap components or deeper Sass functionalities like mixins and functions.

## **Assessment:**
- **Formative Assessment:** Monitor genius progress during guided and independent practice, providing help and feedback as needed.
- **Summative Assessment:** Review the final art gallery projects for completeness, functionality, design, and creativity.

## **Extra Activities:**
- For geniuses who finish early, challenge them to:
  - Add more cards to the gallery with different artworks.
  - Implement different Bootstrap components such as tooltips or dropdowns.
  - Explore advanced Sass functionalities like nesting, mixins, or functions.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- **Reflection:** Evaluate how well geniuses grasped the concepts of using Sass to customize Bootstrap. Identify any areas where multiple geniuses struggled.
- **Takeaways:** Consider adjusting the pacing or providing more examples and resources for any concepts that were challenging. Gather genius feedback to improve future lessons.
