## Lesson Plan: Creating a Landing Page with Bootstrap Components

## **Duration:**
1 hour and 30 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
In this lesson, geniuses will learn how to create a responsive landing page using Bootstrap. They will work with commonly used Bootstrap components such as navbars, modals, and cards. This hands-on lesson guides geniuses through building and completing a web page with intentional gaps for them to fill and customize.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand the structure and purpose of commonly used Bootstrap components.
- Utilize Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing landing page.
- Gain experience in customizing and integrating Bootstrap elements.
- Develop problem-solving skills by completing a partially finished project.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with internet access
- Text editor (such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or Notepad++)
- Bootstrap documentation: [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- Starter code files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`)

## **Standards:**
- Understanding and utilizing CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
- Basic web development skills including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Building responsive web designs.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Teach geniuses the basic structure of a Bootstrap project.
   - Demonstrate how to include Bootstrap in a project using CDN links.
   - Walk through the starter code (`index.html`) provided, explaining the structure and Bootstrap components used.
   - Highlight the blank sections in the code that geniuses will complete.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 30 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Guide geniuses through completing the blanks in the provided code.
   - Work together on the navbar section, adding a fourth navigation link.
   - Guide geiuses to complete the button in the hero section.
   - Offer hints and help as geniuses work on the second card and the modal.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Allow geniuses to complete and customize their landing pages independently.
   - Geniuses should finish the assigned sections (completing cards, modal content, etc.).
   - Encourage geniuses to add custom styles in `styles.css` to personalize their landing pages.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the key points of the lesson and reinforce learning.
   - Review the completed project highlighting the use of Bootstrap components.
   - Discuss the importance of responsive design and how Bootstrap addresses this.
   - Preview the next lesson, which could involve advanced Bootstrap components or adding more interactivity with JavaScript.

## **Assessment:**
- **Formative Assessment:** Monitor genius progress during guided and independent practice, providing help and feedback as needed.
- **Summative Assessment:** Review the final landing page projects for completeness, functionality, design, and creativity.

## **Extra Activities:**
- For geniuses who finish early, challenge them to:
  - Add additional cards and customize their content.
  - Add a footer using Bootstrap's grid system.
  - Implement a carousel component on the landing page.
  - Enhance the page with additional interactive JavaScript features.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
- **Reflection:** Evaluate how well geniuses grasped the concepts of Bootstrap components and responsive design. Identify any areas where multiple students struggled.
- **Takeaways:** Consider adjusting the pacing or providing more examples and resources for any concepts that were challenging. Gather genius feedback to improve future lessons.
